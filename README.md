Github commands quick cheat sheet: (type in ‘ git ’ by itself for more help information)

Copy the master https: git web link from github.com first.

Open terminal bash or dos command prompt, and cd to the proper directory.

command Line:

1. git clone http:\\add the repository from get hub here -> get the repository from github.
2. git status -> get the status of what is currently in the repository.
3. git add -A -> adds the file to the repository link.
4. git commit -m "write a message note" -> pushes the file to the repository with a message note.
5. git push 
6. git pull
Note: you might have to login again in the command line if a link error.

trouble shoot :

To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.
The git remote add command takes two arguments:
	•	A remote name, for example, origin 
	•	A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git 
For example:
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
# Set a new remote
git remote -v
# Verify new remote
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)

•	To escape a full blown commit without a -m error
For example:
	Press escape, then type :wq
